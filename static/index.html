    <h1>Objective</h1>

    <p>I am looking for a fun job.  Please keep in mind that I took calculus
    for fun.</p>

    <p>After being out of the job-market following our move to West Kelowna, I
    would like to get back into a routine.  </p>

    <p>My ideal company culture encourages teamwork, open and honest
    communication, and self&#45;improvement.</p>

  <p>I mostly enjoy working in JavaScript in a Node.js environment.
  Because of that, my knowledge of client&#45;side JavaScript is also
  strong.  My database&#45;of&#45;choice is PostgreSQL, which is very
  similar to Oracle (where I also feel right&#45;at&#45;home).</p>

  <p>I prefer standards&#45;compliant code that works in most modern
  browsers.  I generally support Internet Explorer 11 (especially when I
  have access to it), but I also have much experience with supporting
  IE8.</p>

  <p>I try to be very light on dependencies.  But when I adopt one, it's
  because of the concepts it provides &mdash; that way the dependency
  can be swapped for a different one if any need arises.</p>
