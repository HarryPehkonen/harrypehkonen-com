<section class="objective">
    <h1>Web Developer</h1>

    <p>I would like to continue to work as a developer with clients who
    require help with workload, troubleshooting/debugging, implementing
    new features, or creating a new web&#45;based app from scratch.  I
    work well alone, but I'm also a pleasure to have as part of a team.
    I can also train other developers.</p>

    <p>I don't shine as a content&#45;creator nor as a graphic designer.
    However, I can easily replicate other samples or examples.</p>

    <p>I have successfully built web&#45;based applications that are
    easy to maintain and upgrade, translated applications from one
    platform to another, found and fixed bugs that other developers had
    given up on, and added new features on time and with minimal
    complexity&#45;increases.</p>

    <p>My ideal company culture encourages teamwork, open and honest
    communication, and self&#45;improvement.</p>

    <h1>Education</h1>

    <h2>Douglas College</h2>

    <p>Off and on since 1995.  General studies just to satisfy my
    curiosity:  Calculus, Statistics, Discrete Mathematics, Physics,
    Chemistry, Programming.  With a GPA greater than 4, I was on the
    Dean's List throughout many semesters.  My current GPA is 3.99.</p>

    <h2>BCIT</h2>

    <p>1987.  Electronics Core.  This was an intensive one year course
    with theory, practical knowledge, and hands-on training.</p>

    <p>Full&#45;stack web&#45;developer.  Website maintenance and

  <p>I mostly enjoy working in JavaScript in a Node.js environment.
  Because of that, my knowledge of client&#45;side JavaScript is also
  strong.  My database&#45;of&#45;choice is PostgreSQL, which is very
  similar to Oracle (where I also feel right&#45;at&#45;home).</p>

  <p>I prefer standards&#45;compliant code that works in most modern
  browsers.  I generally support Internet Explorer 11 (especially when I
  have access to it), but I also have much experience with supporting
  IE8.</p>

  <p>I try to be very light on dependencies.  But when I adopt one, it's
  because of the concepts it provides &mdash; that way the dependency
  can be swapped for a different one if any need arises.</p>
